Some projects for my machine learning class at BYU

Homework 1 - Data visualization

Homeworks 2 and 4 - Kaggle projects on housing prices and poverty level prediction

Homework 5 - Exercises in dimensionality reduction

Final (in production) - The final project, a model for predicting major league baseball players' salaries based on their batting statistics

Homework 3 is missing because it was a simple proposal for the final project
