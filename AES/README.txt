Project #1 - AES

1. You can compile my code by typing "make" in this directory. You can run my code by typing "./aes" after compiling it.

2. For writing the code for the AES algorithm, I only looked at the materials provided on the class website. I did look at stackOverflow for help on the syntax of my PRINTSTATE macro (found in aesMethods.h), as well as another website for help on writing my makefile. 

3. My code passes all test cases in Appendix C.
